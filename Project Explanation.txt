i used both paid version of LLM model and free version or open source LLM model in this chat application 
i used langchain to put everything which is prompt, model,output in a sequence.
and langsmith to monitor my application
for that i used three different types of APIs openAI, llama2, and langsmith 
to run llama2 in my locally on my machine i used ollama which is a tool.
and i created virtual environment to set up my own installments in one place for my project locally.
so if we want to install anything we need to install it in venv\scripts\activate
and put all my APIs in secrets.env file 
amd run everything in streamlit.
